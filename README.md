## 📘 API Reference
AtmosTrack utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API. Here’s a brief overview:

### Weather Data Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **Parameters**:
  - `q`: City name (string)
  - `appid`: Your API key (string)
- **Returns**: JSON object containing weather data.

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "weather": [{ "description": "clear sky" }],
  "main": { "temp": 293.15 },
  "wind": { "speed": 1.5 },
  "sys": { "sunrise": 1622548800, "sunset": 1622600400 }
}
```

## 🧩 Architecture
AtmosTrack follows a simple architecture:

```
┌────────────────────┐
│   index.html      │
├────────────────────┤
│   styles.css      │
├────────────────────┤
│   script.js       │
└────────────────────┘
```

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the application.
- **styles.css**: Contains styles for the application.
- **script.js**: Handles API requests and updates the UI.

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Keep your API key confidential**: Avoid exposing your API key in public repositories.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that all API requests are made over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

## 🧪 Testing
To test the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. For more advanced testing, consider using tools like Jest or Mocha (if applicable).
